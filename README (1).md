# 1 About the project #
* This project studies the relationship between the immigrants to US states and the population demographics, the temperature, and the airports in the relevant state.
* It uses STAR schema to create different dimension and fact tables based on the data sourced publicily.
* The processes utlize on-premise tools. It develops ETL pipelines with Python, PySpark, and SQL.
* It uses AWS S3 to store all the staging data and builds a data warehouse by using AWS Redshift to store staging tables and normalized tables. 
<br >  

# 2 Getting started #
* "Capstone Project AWS.ipynb" contains all the codes for the project.  
* "sql_queries.py" contains all the sql queries to create the staging and normalized tables.
    1. Create S3 bucket and Redshift in the same region and create IAM role for Redshift to copy data from S3. And fill in all the parameters in "dwh.cfg" file.
    2. Launch a new terminal, and "cd" to the current working directory.   
    3. Type "python etl.py" to run ET processes and save the staging files in S3 bucket.  
    4. Then type "python create_insert_tables.py" to create the staging tables in Redshift and insert normalized tables based on the staging tables created. 
    5. Open "test.ipynb" and run all the cells to check whether the tables have been created successfully.

# 3 About the data #
* [I94 Immigration Data](https://www.trade.gov/national-travel-and-tourism-office): This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office.
* [World Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?resource=download): This dataset came from Kaggle.
* [U.S. City Demographic Data](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/): This data comes from OpenSoft.
* [Airport Code Table](https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#pandas): This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities.

# 4 Schema and ETL #
* STAR Schema
    * dimension tables
        * dim_airports ("State" PK; "num_airports")
        * dim_temperature ("State", PK; "min_tm"; "max_tm")
        * dim_population ("State", PK; age, gender, race population, household, etc)
    * fact tables
        * fact_tourists ("cicid", PK; "State", FK)  
<br>

* ETL
    * airports
        1. to numeric "elevation_ft"
        2. Separate "iso_region" to two columns  
        3. Separate "coordinates" to two columns and round
        4. Drop other airport type only keeping "airport" & not closed
        5. Only include US
    * cities
        1. Transform columns "Race" and "Count" from long to wide
        2. To numeric: "Male Population", "Female Population", "Total Population", "Number of Veterans", "Foreign-born", "Count"
        3. To float: "Median Age", "Average Household Size"    
    * immigration
        1. to date "arrdate", "depdate", "dtadfile"
        2. to text "cicid", "i94cit", "i94res", "admnum"
        3. to integer "i94yr", "i94mon", "i94mode", "i94bir", "	i94visa", "count" 
        4. only keep the records with "i94addr" the same as the state codes in "cities" table
    * temperature
        1. Only include 2003 onwards of temperature for data usage
        2. Only include US
